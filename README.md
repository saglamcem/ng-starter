# NgStarter

This project serves as a base project with some guidelines I try to follow in any Angular project. 

#### Includes 

* a core / shared / feature module architecture 
* Jest as the testing tool instead of Karma 
* Cypress for e2e instead of Protractor 
* Angular Material as the ui component library 

You'd like to use the project but feel like it's missing something? Feel free to let me know in issues and contribute via PR's.
